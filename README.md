JavaScript Course 

This is for Git Course Practice and Notes
~ here I Learned how to upload a local project from machine to remote repo on git
1. create repo on github
2. work on your project at local
3. perform add, commit commands while working
4. git remote add origin "repo link of http "
5. change the branch from master to main => git branch -M main
6. git push -u origin main
7. after this command with -u, we can use simple git push


Branches

Navigate,Craete, Delete
Navgaite=> git checkout 'branch name'

Craete=> git checkout -b change-color-freature
Now go from Main to change-color-: branch  => git checkout change-colot-feature

Delete
  git bramch -d change-color-freature  (!We can not delete branch in which we already exists, to del the branch, we've to move from that branch to antoher)
